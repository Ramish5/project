Problem Statement-:In the traditional banking sector, maintaining manual records of account holders, balances, and daily transactions is labor-intensive, prone to human error, and inefficient. Furthermore, for students and beginner developers, understanding how backend software manages persistent data, security (PINs), and state (account balances) is a critical learning curve.
Project Objective-:The primary objective of this project is to develop a Console-Based Banking Application that simulates the real-world operations of a bank.
Scope of the Project-:This project covers the fundamental aspects of a banking environment:
                                    -Dynamic creation of accounts with User Name, PIN, and Initial Deposit.
                                    -Automatic generation of unique 5-digit Account Numbers to simulate real banking IDs.
                                    -A recursive menu system that allows users to log in, perform multiple tasks, and log out without terminating the main program.
Conclusion-:
    -The Simple Banking System successfully addresses the problem of manual account management by providing a digital interface for financial operations. It serves as a robust educational tool, demonstrating how secure, logic-based applications are architected using Object-Oriented Programming
