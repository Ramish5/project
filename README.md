My Vithyarthi Project - Simple Banking System 
This"Simple Banking System" allows users to create virtual bank accounts, secure them with a PIN, and perform basic financial transactions. It uses a dynamic menu-driven interface to handle multiple customers within a single runtime session.
Features:
-Users can register with a Name and a secure 4-digit PIN.
-The system automatically assigns a unique random 5-digit Account Number (10000-99999).
-Access to account features is restricted by Account Number and PIN authentication.
To run this project, you need:
-Python 3.x installed on your system.
-No external libraries are required (uses standard random library).
Usage Guide:
MAIN MENU-
-Enter your name, set a 4-digit PIN, and an initial deposit. Note the generated Account Number! You will need it to log in.
-Enter your Account Number and PIN to access your funds.
-Closes the application.
USER MENU-
-Check Balance: View current available funds.
-Deposit Money: Add funds to your account.
-Withdraw Money: Withdraw funds (if balance permits).
-Transaction History: View a list of all past transactions.
-Logout: Return to the Main Menu.
Limitations-:
-This system uses in-memory storage (a Python Dictionary). If you close the program, all account data and transaction histories are lost.
-Designed for a single active terminal session.
Future Enhancements-:
-Implement text file or CSV storage to save account data permanently.
-Allow transferring funds between two different account numbers.
